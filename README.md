# SnapScript

## Medication management mobile app with AI-powered label scanning

SnapScript is a mobile app built with React Native and Expo that makes managing medications simple and reliable. Its key feature is the ability to scan a prescription label with your phoneâ€™s camera, automatically extracting dosage, schedule, and refill details using OCR and AI. Users can also add medications manually, receive smart daily and refill reminders, and search a built-in database for medication information.
